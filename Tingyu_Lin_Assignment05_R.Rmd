```


### Ecercise 7

```{r}

# Exercise (7)
# first GET request that searches for event venues in Germany
API_DE <- GET("https://app.ticketmaster.com/discovery/v2/venues.json?",
                   query = list("countryCode" = "DE",
                                "apikey" = api_key)) 

# extract content
API_decontent <- content(API_DE)

# number of page and observation
n <- as.data.frame(API_decontent[["page"]])



```

From data frame, it suggests that each page contains 20 observations, and there are `r n$Elements` events in Germany, which make them `r n$totalPages`-page long. And we are currently at page 0.
